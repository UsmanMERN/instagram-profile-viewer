# Instagram Profile Viewer: My Flask & Instagrapi Project

Hey there! I‚Äôm thrilled to share my **Instagram Profile Viewer**, a Flask-powered app I built to download Instagram stories, posts, reels, highlights, and profile details using the awesome **instagrapi** library. I poured my heart into creating a sleek, user-friendly UI/UX that‚Äôs responsive and intuitive, making it super easy to explore and download Instagram content. Whether you‚Äôre grabbing stories or diving into profile details, this app has it all! I‚Äôve optimized it for serverless deployment on **Vercel** and included a **Dockerfile** for traditional hosting. With lazy loading, pagination, and robust error handling, everything runs smoothly. I‚Äôd love for you to check it out, star the repo, and maybe even contribute!

üåü **Please star this repo** on [GitHub](https://github.com/UsmanMERN/instagram-profile-viewer) to show your support and help others find this project!  
üôå **Contributors are welcome!** If you‚Äôre excited about this project, jump in‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs fixing bugs, adding features, or improving the UI. Let‚Äôs make this even better together!
üöÄ **More Tools Coming!** I‚Äôve built tons of other cool tools like this one‚Äîthink Snapchat downloaders, YouTube tools like YouTube converters, youtube downloader, and so much more. If this project gets some love, I‚Äôll release those too, so show some support!

## What‚Äôs Cool About This Project?

- **Download All the Instagram Goodies**: Fetch stories, posts, reels, highlights, and profile details effortlessly.
- **Stunning UI/UX**: I crafted a modern, responsive interface that shines on desktops, tablets, and phones.
- **Lazy Loading Magic**: Media previews load first, with full content fetched on demand for a fast, efficient experience.
- **Pagination Done Right**: Seamlessly scroll through posts and reels with paginated API endpoints.
- **Smart Session Management**: Uses **instagrapi** to store login sessions in a `session.json` file, so you don‚Äôt need to log in repeatedly.
- **Timezone Support**: Converts timestamps to Asia/Kolkata timezone for a localized touch.
- **Serverless Ready**: Deploys effortlessly on Vercel with a custom `vercel.json` configuration.
- **Docker Support**: Includes a `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment on any server.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles Instagram rate limits, invalid sessions, and private accounts.
- **Custom Number Formatting**: Added a Jinja2 filter to display follower counts in a readable format (e.g., 1.2M, 5.6K).
- **SEO-Friendly**: Packed with keywords to help folks find this project when searching for Instagram downloaders.

## Tech Stack I Used

- **Backend**: Flask (my favorite Python web framework)
- **Instagram API**: instagrapi (huge props to this amazing library!)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a polished, responsive UI)
- **Deployment**: Vercel for serverless hosting, Docker for containerized setups
- **Dependencies**: Python 3.9+, requests, pytz, base64, Flask, instagrapi
- **Timezone Handling**: pytz for accurate timestamp conversions

## How to Get Started

### What You‚Äôll Need

- **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher
- **pip**: Python package manager
- **Git**: To clone my repo
- **Vercel CLI**: For serverless deployment (optional)
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment (optional)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone My Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UsmanMERN/instagram-profile-viewer.git
   cd instagram-profile-viewer
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Add Your Instagram Credentials**
   - Open `app.py` and plug in your Instagram username and password:
     ```python
     USERNAME = "your_instagram_username_here"
     PASSWORD = "your_instagram_password_here"
     SESSION_FILE = "session.json"
     ```
   - **Pro Tip**: Keep your credentials secure! Never commit them to a public repo.

5. **Run the App Locally**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - The app will be live at `http://localhost:8080`.

6. **Check Out the UI**
   - Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and explore the sleek interface I built!

### Dependencies

Here‚Äôs what you need in your `requirements.txt`:
```
Flask==2.0.1
instagrapi==1.16.35
requests==2.28.1
pytz==2023.3
```

Install them with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deploying the App

### Vercel (Serverless Hosting)

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Set Up `vercel.json`**
   I‚Äôve included a `vercel.json` file for seamless serverless deployment:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "builds": [
       {
         "src": "app.py",
         "use": "@vercel/python"
       }
     ],
     "routes": [
       {
         "src": "/(.*)",
         "dest": "app.py"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   - Follow the prompts to deploy.
   - Set environment variables (`USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, `SESSION_FILE`) in the Vercel dashboard.

4. **Access Your App**
   - Vercel will provide a URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`) to access the app.

### Docker (Containerized Hosting)

1. **Create a `Dockerfile`**
   I‚Äôve added a `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment:
   ```dockerfile
   # Use official Python image
   FROM python:3.9-slim

   # Set working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy requirements and install dependencies
   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Copy application code
   COPY . .

   # Expose port
   EXPOSE 8080

   # Command to run the application
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Docker Container**
   ```bash
   docker build -t instagram-profile-viewer .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 -e USERNAME=your_username -e PASSWORD=your_password instagram-profile-viewer
   ```

3. **Access the App**
   - Head to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## How to Use It

1. **Home Page**: Visit the root URL (`/`) to see my awesome UI, starting with the "Stories" tab.
2. **Download Stories**: Enter an Instagram username to fetch stories, complete with previews and viewer details (for your own stories).
3. **Download Posts/Reels**: Paste a post or reel URL to grab media and metadata like likes, comments, and captions.
4. **View Highlights**: Check out highlight metadata and load individual items on demand.
5. **Profile Details**: Get rich profile info, including followers, following, bio, and profile picture.
6. **Lazy Loading**: Media loads only when needed via the `/download_media_content` endpoint‚Äîsuper efficient!
7. **Pagination**: Use `/get_posts` and `/get_reels` to fetch more content with smooth pagination.

## API Endpoints I Built

- **GET /**: Loads the main UI with the "Stories" tab active.
- **GET /profile?username=<username>**: Fetches profile details for a given username.
- **GET /stories?username=<username>&user_id=<user_id>**: Grabs stories for a user.
- **POST /download_story**: Downloads stories and profile details for a username.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This application is for **educational purposes only**. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Instagram or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Be responsible and respect the privacy and content of others.

## Notes
